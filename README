# Memory Management Simulator

## Overview

This project implements a **memory management simulator** in C++. The program simulates how an operating system handles process memory using paging techniques and employs LRU (Least Recently Used)and FIFO (first in first out) as the page replacement policy. It allows loading, running, and managing processes, including process termination and memory handling.

## Features

- **Load Processes:** Load processes from input files, assign unique process IDs, and allocate memory pages in memory space and if it gets filled then allocate memory in swapspace .
- **Run Processes:** Simulate execution of processes, handling paging and memory access.
- **Page Replacement:** Uses the LRU page replacement policy or the FIFO policy to swap pages between main memory and swap space when needed.
- **Kill Process:** Terminate a process, freeing up all its memory pages from both main memory and swap space.
- **Print Page Table:** Output the page table entries for individual processes or all processes.

## Commands Supported in the infile

1. **load** `<filename(s)>`
   - Loads one or more files as processes and assigns them unique process IDs.
   
2. **run** `<pid>`
   - Runs a process based on its process ID (pid) and simulates commands such as `load`, `add`, `sub`, and `print`.
   
3. **kill** `<pid>`
   - Terminates the process with the given process ID, freeing its memory.
   
4. **listpr**
   - Lists all the active processes.
   
5. **pte** `<pid> <file>`
   - Prints the page table entries for the specified process into a file.
   
6. **pteall** `<file>`
   - Prints the page table entries for all processes into a file.
   
7. **print** `<memloc> <length>`
   - Prints the values stored at a specific memory location and the next `length` bytes.
   
8. **exit**
   - Terminates all processes and cleans up memory.

## How to Use

### Compilation
To compile the program, use the following command:

```bash
make 

./lru/fifo -M [main_memory_size] -V [Swapspace_size] -P [Pagesize] -i infile -o outfile
